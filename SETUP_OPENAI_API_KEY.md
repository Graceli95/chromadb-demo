## üéØ Getting Your API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy your key (starts with `sk-...`)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Save it somewhere safe - you won't be able to see it again!

## üîç The Problem We Solved

### Initial Issue
When running the `step6_openai_embeddings.py` script, we encountered:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found!
```

### Root Cause
The Python script uses `os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')` to retrieve the API key from environment variables. If this variable isn't set in the shell environment where the script runs, it returns `None`.

### Why It Was Tricky
- Setting the key in one terminal window doesn't automatically make it available to other processes
- Each new shell session or subprocess starts fresh without custom environment variables
- Temporary exports (`export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'`) only last for that terminal session

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Setting Environment Variables on macOS

Since you're using **zsh** (macOS default shell), here's how we fixed it permanently:

### Step 1: Edit Your Shell Configuration File

Open your `~/.zshrc` file in a text editor:
```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Add the Environment Variable

Scroll to the bottom of the file and add this line:
```bash
# OpenAI API Key for ChromaDB demos
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-actual-key-here'
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `sk-your-actual-key-here` with your actual API key
- Keep the single quotes around the key
- The `export` keyword makes the variable available to all child processes

### Step 3: Save and Exit
- Press `Ctrl + X`
- Press `Y` to confirm
- Press `Enter` to save

### Step 4: Reload Your Shell Configuration
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This command reloads your zsh configuration, making the environment variable available immediately.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Verification

### Test 1: Check the Variable is Set
```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Expected Output:** Your API key (e.g., `sk-svcac...JhAA`)

**If empty:** The variable wasn't set correctly. Double-check your `~/.zshrc` file.

### Test 2: Run the ChromaDB Script
```bash
cd /path/to/chromadb-demo
source venv/bin/activate
python step6_openai_embeddings.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ OpenAI API key found!
   Key preview: sk-svcac...JhAA
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Variable Still Not Found

**Issue:** After setting in `~/.zshrc`, the script still says "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure you sourced the file:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Check for typos:**
   ```bash
   # Wrong (typo in variable name)
   export OPENA_PI_KEY='sk-...'
   
   # Correct
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
   ```

3. **Verify the variable in the same terminal:**
   ```bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

4. **For automated tools/scripts:** Some tools start fresh shells. You may need to source `~/.zshrc` in the command:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc && python step6_openai_embeddings.py
   ```

### Problem: Security Concerns

**Issue:** Storing API keys in plain text files

**Best Practices:**

1. **Never commit API keys to git:**
   - Our `.gitignore` already excludes `.env` files
   - Double-check with: `git status` before pushing

2. **Use `.env` files for projects (Alternative method):**
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in your project
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key'" > .env
   
   # Load it in your Python script
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   ```

3. **Rotate your keys regularly:**
   - Go to OpenAI Platform
   - Revoke old keys
   - Generate new ones

4. **Use different keys for different projects:**
   - This limits damage if one key is compromised

---

### Problem: Key Works in Terminal but Not in Scripts

**Issue:** `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY` works, but Python script doesn't see it

**Solution:** The script might be running in a different environment. Make sure:

1. You're running the script from the same terminal where you verified the key
2. You've sourced `~/.zshrc` in the current session
3. If using virtual environments, the key is set BEFORE activating the venv

**Correct order:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc           # Load environment variables
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
python script.py          # Run script
```

## üéì Understanding Environment Variables

### What Are Environment Variables?
Environment variables are key-value pairs that are available to all programs running in a shell session. Think of them as "global settings" for your terminal.

### Why Use Them for API Keys?
- **Security**: Keeps secrets out of your code
- **Flexibility**: Easy to change without modifying code
- **Portability**: Different environments can have different keys

### Common Use Cases
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for OpenAI services
- `PATH` - Directories where executable programs are located
- `HOME` - Your home directory path
- `USER` - Your username

### Viewing All Environment Variables
```bash
printenv
# or
env
```

## üìù Alternative Methods (For Reference)

### Method 1: Temporary Export (Session Only)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key'
```
**Pros:** Quick, no file editing
**Cons:** Only lasts until you close the terminal

### Method 2: `.zshrc` File (What We Used) ‚úÖ
```bash
# In ~/.zshrc
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key'
```
**Pros:** Persistent, automatic, available in all new terminals
**Cons:** Key is stored in plain text on your computer

### Method 3: `.env` File (Project-Specific)
```bash
# In project/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```
**Pros:** Project-isolated, easier to manage multiple keys
**Cons:** Need to load it explicitly in your code

### Method 4: macOS Keychain (Most Secure)
```bash
# Store in keychain
security add-generic-password -a $USER -s openai_api_key -w "sk-your-key"

# Retrieve in script
security find-generic-password -a $USER -s openai_api_key -w
```
**Pros:** Most secure, encrypted
**Cons:** More complex to set up
